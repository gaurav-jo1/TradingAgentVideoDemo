# Lessons Learned

* **Data is King**: Clean, structured, and voluminous data is critical for training effective trading agents.



* **Team Effort**: Professional trading systems require collaboration between data engineers, quant researchers, and RL experts.



* **Iterative Process**: Building an MVP is just the startâ€”real-world systems use ensemble methods and extensive simulations.

Happy trading! ðŸš€
